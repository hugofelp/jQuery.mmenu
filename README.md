jQuery.mmenu v5.3.1 - Less Port
================

Unofficial port from Sass to Less of jQuery mmenu v5.3.1. For original library, documentation and support: http://mmenu.frebsite.nl

This port is compatible with version v5.3.1 and will not be maintained. Although, anyone is welcome to do so, as long as the original license is respected.

There are a few ugly hacks that could be removed when using a javascript compiler. I kept them in for compatibility with dotless compiler in Visual Studio.

**Grunt**
There is a simple Gruntfile provided, with a single task for compiling the files into a css. If you have nodejs(w/ npm) and grunt-cli installed globally, just run npm install, then grunt from the command line.
